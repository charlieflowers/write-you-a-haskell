What were my original questions?
1. I need to write the bind fn myself, first without the newtype and 
then with it.
2. I was trying to figure out if non-determinism was Steven's goal for list and
bind. The answer is yes. Even though Parsec doesn't use nondetermism (usualklky),
Steven was borrowing a monadic parser from Functional Pearls, just to 
illustratre the concept of functional parsers. And that Functional Pearls 
parser DOES use lists in the monad to handle non-determinism.
3. To do the job, monadic parsers DON'T HAVE TO TRACK POSITION! Parsec
does track position for good error messages. But NOT to do the task of parsing!
Each parser fn returns the unconsumed input, and the next parser picks up right 
there!
